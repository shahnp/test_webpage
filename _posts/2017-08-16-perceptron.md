# Purpose :
A Marketer is interested in knowing what product is purchased with what product or if certain products are purchased together as a group of items which they can use to strategize on the cross selling activities.

# Key Term and Things to know:
- Market Basket Analysis 
- Apriori algorithm 
- Association rule learning
- support
- confidence lift and conviction

# Measuring rule importance by using
support and confidence.
Support and confidence are the two criteria to help us decide whether a pattern is “interesting”. By setting thresholds for these two criteria, we can easily limit the number of interesting rules or item- sets reported.


# Apriori & FP growth Algorithm.
Mining association rules and frequent item sets allows for the discovery of interesting and useful connections or relationships between items.
The objectives of the study are the following:
Most of the Market Basket Analysis are done 
- to obtain association rules 
- analyze them for better decision support 
- better understanding of data association 
- increasing company profit using the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithm 
- to analyze association rules based on relevance, interestingness, and correlation, 
- Use lift, Imbalance Ratio (IR), and Kulczynski (Kulc) measure as correlation measures.

# Information about Datasets:
Implementing MBA/Association Rule Mining using R
In this project, we will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is called Online-Retail, and we can download it from here (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).
The dataset contains transaction data from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based registered non-store online retail.

# Frequency plot of top 10 Items:
- Absolute Item Frequency Plot
- Top 10 Relative Item Frequency Plot

# Visualization 

Some of the Visualization Option:
- Scatter-Plot
- The two-key plot
- Graph-Based Visualizations
- Interactive Scatter-plot
- Individual Rule Representation Scatter-Plot


- Transactions per month
- Transactions per weekday
- Transactions per hour
- No. of transactions with di erent basket sizes
